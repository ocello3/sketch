Designed by Yasuhiro Tsuchiya
The simple sound kit for designing a variety of interactions. All sounds are designed based on sine waves; the smallest pure element of sound. It is designed to be as simple as possible with a small file size, focusing on a frequency range that can be reproduced even by speakers with relatively low playback capabilities, so it can be used in a variety of situations such as web, applications, and digital signage.
